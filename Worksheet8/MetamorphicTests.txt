Metamorphic Relations (MRs):
	- MR: Adding Filters Reduces Results
	Scenario: Perform a search without any filters, then add a filter (e.g., “Free Wi-Fi”).
	Expectation: The number of results should decrease or stay the same.

	- MR: Removing Filters Increases Results
	Scenario: Start with a filtered search (e.g., “Pool”), then remove the filter.
	Expectation: The number of results should increase or stay the same.

	- MR: Sorting Results Consistency
	Scenario: Sort the results by price (low to high) and then by rating (high to low).
	Expectation: The total number of results should remain the same.

	- MR: Location-Based Subset
	Scenario: Search for hotels in a broader area (e.g., “Berlin”) and then in a specific district (e.g., “Berlin-Mitte”).
	Expectation: Results in the specific district should be a subset of the broader area.

	- MR: Changing Dates Affects Availability
	Scenario: Search for hotels on one set of dates and then extend the date range.
	Expectation: More hotels should show availability or stay the same.

	- MR: Adding Guests Should Not Remove Hotels
	Scenario: Search for 1 guest, then increase the number of guests to 4.
    Expectation: Results should stay the same or include hotels that can accommodate the new guest count.
